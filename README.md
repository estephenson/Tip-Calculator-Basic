## Notes
This was my first time working in XCode, and it was a much different experience than I was used to - it was odd to have the
graphic/interface side of things be so easily meshed with the code. I didn't run into any difficulties, and while I would
like to keep going and make the app more interesting/functional, I just don't know enough about the capabilities of XCode to 
implement more advanced things like animation.
